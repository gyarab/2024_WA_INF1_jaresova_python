            "about": "This game was inspired by the film ratatouille. It has a main storyline but also side misions with some minigames, my favourite ones are platformer levels that happen when Remi goes to sleep and wakes up in dreamland, it has an amazing soundtrack. Another minigame worth mentioning is a sequence where you slide down a sewer pipe and have to avoid obstacles, it is fairly long and takes place after the end of every chapter of the main story. There are also bonus secret features that can be unlocked by collecting the collectibles in the game or using your hard earned points.",

The game is based on the movie of the same name, but it has a lot of extra content that wasn't in the movie. It has a lot of collectibles and also a multiplayer mode, where you can play with your friends (although on the same computer).",

The game has wonky graphics and animations, but it is dubbed by the actual voice actors of individual characters. Every CD also includes minigames that are often educational in some way, for example a game where you have to type words fast and correctly to fend off enemies, it teaches kids how to type on a keyboard, or a game based around matching czech words with their english counterparts. Even though it isn't the best game out there, it holds a special place within my childhood memories.",

You take care of your pet, feed them, play with them, train them, clean up their room, wash them, etc. You can also take them for a walk, where you can meet other pets and their owners and also take part in competitions, where you can win money and buy new outfits, food, or shampoos for your pet. It's a surprisingly well developed game for such a small game studio and low budget, it can be truly seen that they put a lot of thought and passion into it.",
